      "Mission": "The Department of Global Korean Studies (GKS) nurtures engaged, creative, global citizens and leaders of twenty-first century knowledge development through an integrated study of Korea from a global perspective. GKS students study various aspects of the global construction of modern and contemporary Korea in order to understand Korea constructed by the world, Korea constructing the world, and Korea understood by the world. In so doing, students gain not only an extensive knowledge of Korea but also learn how knowledge about Korea is produced, both in Korea and around the world. As future leaders in academia, creative industries, information technology, publishing, global journalism, government and non-governmental organizations, and entrepreneurship, GKS graduates bring knowledge of Korea to the world and a knowledge of the world to Korea.",
      "Bachelor of Arts in Global Korean Studies": "The Bachelor of Arts in Global Korean Studies Program provides an elite liberal arts education to the next generation of global leaders. Korea as an object of study presents students with the opportunity to understand the diverse ways that Korea is known on the peninsula and around the world, situating GKS students at a hub of international discourse. Studying at this global intersection, GKS students develop uniquely broad international perspectives, as well as exceptional analytical and communication skills. A deep knowledge of Korea and the practical skills of knowledge development documentation and curation, quantitative and qualitative analysis, argument and creative expression as they are practiced with millennia-old and next-generation technological equipments and positions students in GKS as global leaders of twenty-first century knowledge creation. Courses in the Department of Global Korean Studies are taught in English. However, Korean language skills are required in order to participate successfully. Students, therefore, are expected to have native or near-native fluency in English and a working knowledge of both languages before entering the B.A. Program in Global Korean Studies."

Students will learn about knowledge production that underpins our approach to any social science inquiry as well as how to ask and answer empirical research questions. The course will begin with introducing critical reading and thinking, the foundational elements of social science inquiry. The course then explores the processes of social science inquiry, including the construction of research questions, literature review, causal reasoning, the selection of methodology and methods, the techniques and tools of data gathering and analysis, and writing up your research conclusion. The course also introduces qualitative and quantitative studies. The course sequence will guide you to develop your research proposal step by step through the semester and present it at the end of the semester. This course will be devoted to helping you acquire pivotal reading, thinking, and research skills necessary to successfully complete tertiary education. Remember that the practical knowledge and skills you earned in the course are transferable and will guide you in other university courses and beyond."

Global citizenship refers to the belief that individuals no longer belong to isolated communities such as nation-states. Rather, they are members of multiple and diverse communities, the nature of which is changing as they interact with each other. This course provides an overview of the evolving concept of global citizenship and explores the virtue of the concept by relating it to various debates about international development cooperation, poverty alleviation and the growing importance and awareness of sustainable development for all. In doing so, the course aims to foster responsible global citizens."

Of particular interest are conceptions of time and space, forms of representation, as well as the construction of meaning and identity. Additionally, this course delves into various 20th century efforts to create new forms of media production that blend pedagogical goals with artistic experimentation. Many artists seek to surpass their function as entertainers or creators of beautiful-but-useless cultural objects by insisting on their art's capacity to teach. The tradition to create pedagogical art has laid the foundation for avant-garde movements in Asia, including Korea. Throughout the course, students will explore different models of pedagogical art to illustrate how the function of art has been defined and delimited and how new functions and conceptualization of art have emerged, while building on the formal possibilities."

As with Computing Korean Culture, this course begins with an investigation of the book, that central technology of culture and knowledge production. The course then contemplates reading and editorial practice in Korean cultural context, as well as modeling and design as they relate to data curation, visualization, and newer forms of knowledge about Korea. Students’ investigation of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and network analysis will be advanced through a number of handson projects. Students will also be introduced to the principles of machine learning by conducting machine learning experiments in cloud computing environments, such as Microsoft's Machine Learning Studio. In addition, students will test experimental image mining software. Key terms (information, code, data, digital object, materiality, posthumanism) will be examined at greater depths as they relate to the study of Korea, along with new and old theoretical approaches (close reading, distant reading, sociology of texts, algorithmic criticism) and areas of study (critical code studies, software studies, platform studies, and media archaeology). While researching a subject of her or his choosing, students will develop websites and cultural atlases, as well as advance their understanding of coding for the web. By the end of the course, students will be able to compose a sophisticated academic argument using new media and/or enhance traditional research papers with data and analysis enabled by digital methods and tools. Along with a working knowledge of html, css, javascript and various data cleaning, mining and visualization tools, students will take away a deep understanding of Korea and the ways that data and digital technologies can illuminate it."
