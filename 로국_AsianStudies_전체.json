            "Overview": "Our Asian Studies program approaches Asia with an emphasis on gaining a broader understanding of the region by utilizing knowledge and perspectives across a wide range of disciplines. Asia, now, is possibly the most dynamic area of the world economy. Countries in the region are ever more interconnected – not only through investment and trade, but also politically and culturally through global processes of diplomacy, migration, popular culture, and tourism. Our Asian Studies program therefore aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience that: 1) enables students to fully appreciate the interconnectedness within/of the region and beyond; 2) exposes students to diverse disciplinary approaches (including culture, geography, history, international development/cooperation, international relations, and politics). In addition to the subject-based modules, students will also be able to enrich their learning in/on Asia via our basic-level East Asian language courses or various Asia-related emersion and exchange programs. In order to create a stimulating learning environment for students, we will organize various Asia-related activities/events and special lectures/talks by professionals from diverse backgrounds, including academics and practitioners.",
            "Career Paths": "Students who completed the Asian Studies major at Loyola College will have the expertise and skills to work as an Asia expert and enter a variety of fields, including international organizations in Korea and abroad, media, education, culture, business, and academia.",
